# PyTorchLightningSkeleton
---
This repository contains skeleton for starting new project in PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning.

I made this for my custom preference, if you have any suggestions or better way to do things please let me know.
Most of the things should be easy to use and comments should be self explainatory, otherwise feel free to ask a question or look for the vast PyTorch and PyTorch lightning documentation
